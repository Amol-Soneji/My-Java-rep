# Unit Converter

This Java program converts a measurement of one unit, into another unit.  This program can also convert from US units to SI units and vice-versa.  It can also show the market currency exchange rate of different currencies.  

This program does not use a GUI, and utilizes the command line.  

Currently I am taking a vacation from this project, I have to find a free API compatible with Java that can get currency rates from market.  I also am busy with searching for a job.
