# File Encryptor and Decryptor

This program is currently in the planning phase, and thus this README currntly states what I am sure will be a feature or available in the program.  

This program will be able to encrypt/decrypt files.  It will also be able to create (a)symetric key(s) for the different ciphers that this program will support.  
More info on the currently planed ciphers that this program will support can be found in the plan/Planned Fetures.txt file.
