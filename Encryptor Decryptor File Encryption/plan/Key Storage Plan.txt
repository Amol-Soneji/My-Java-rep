For the key storage I will use SQLite with it's JDBC driver.  
I will get the JDBC driver.  [Done]
Then from there I will create a class that will interact with the SQLite databse.  
Then I will create a class that will send and interpret data to and from the class above, to store key objects as well as create specific key objects.
